# Rust Server Monitor

## Overview

The **Rust Server Monitor** is a Python script that continuously monitors a Rust game server using the **A2S_INFO (Source Engine Query) protocol**.  
It can detect if the server is **UP** or **DOWN**, logs the results to a file, and sends **real-time Discord notifications** for every ping.

This version supports **interactive input** for server IP or DNS and port, and **automatic notifications** via a hard-coded Discord webhook.
